Hi, I'm Anıl.

I started writing software in 2011. I developed games, mobile apps, desktop GUI apps, back-end and scientific methods.
I'm currently working as a Scientific Software Developer at the Blue Brain Project.

I also voluntarily serve as a contributing member at the Python Software Foundation. [wiki.python.org/psf/AnilTuncel.](https://wiki.python.org/psf/AnilTuncel)

I am a big fan of open-source software ecosystem. Unlike in other engineering disciplines, in software engineering you can work with the best minds in the world and learn from their experiences just from your room and in your own time zone. This is possible thanks to open-source.
In my free time, I am contributing to some interesting open-source projects. Check out my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/anilbey) for more information.

I also publish scientific articles. I believe there is a lot of knowledge a computer scientist can transfer to other scientific disciplines. Computer science, in fact, is the discipline of knowledge. In Turkish, it is called `bilişim`, comes from the verb `bilmek` that means `to know`. In Latin it's called `informatica`, the same root as `information`. Once the information is acquired and the knowledge is built, all domains benefit.
My articles are mostly on applications of computer science to multidisciplinary fields such as neuroscience, bioinformatics and genetics.
I also did some work on Recommender Systems and Machine Learning. You can find all of them on my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bTmGQ3cAAAAJ&hl=en).

At some point in my career, I was thinking whether I should focus more on the scientific side or the engineering side. After a careful consideration, I decided that the asset I find most valuable is the solid foundation of software engineering skills.

I am a public speaker. I have given talks at both scientific and engineering conferences.
Here are some of those talks.

I also read a lot books and articles. I will be writing about some of them in this blog. Lastly, I play the oud instrument.
