It has been 8 years since I last wrote a blog post. In the meantime I have been thinking about ideas and taking notes of them, but I find those techniques not as effective as writing. This image below illustrates the importance of writing (better than the words I could utter).

This time, I used a static page generator, namelyÂ [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), to manage the content. I like to treat the contents of the blog as code.

I used Dall-E to generate the avatar as well as the favicon (the icon shown on the browser tab). It did a fantastic job. I think the recent advancements in AI (Dall-E, GPT, Copilot) are the biggest achievements of our civilisation.

I will write about software development, programming languages and some promising technologies. I will also write about the books or articles that impressed and/or influenced me.

I am learning Rust nowadays, and I find it to be a very promising technology. Some Rust posts will follow soon.

I am not sure if the RSS feed works yet. Subscribe to get the latest posts if it is working :)

Happy reading.
